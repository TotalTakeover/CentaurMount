"Centaur Mount" is a mod that adds mounts to Terraria that make you a centaur. There are currently 5 Mounts to choose from. These Mounts can be made from various (obvious) items at a cooking pot/Mythril Anvil.

Current bugs:
*<Priority> Horse Based Mounts can run fast, but they cannot prove it by dashing. They just walk really fast instead.
*<priority> Back items do not attach properly on back for various mounts (too high)
*Need to add Double Jump To Unicorn Mount
*Legs occasionally slightly appear
*Horse Based Mounts are in the floor 2 pixels at all times
*Reindeer Mount Nose does not glow. When Flying, there is now glow on feet as well
*HitBoxes.

If there are issues with this mod that I did not find, please make a pull request on the Repository page. ( https://github.com/TotalTakeover/CentaurMount )

Like Most Mounts, you cannot use a grappling hook without disconnecting from the Mount.

Upcoming Features:
*Different Colors/Species

Unlikely Upcoming features:
*Accessories/Vanity/armor that allows for lower body defense and stats.
*Maybe a Homepage
