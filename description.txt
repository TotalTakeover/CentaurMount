"Centaur Mount" is a mod that adds mounts to Terraria that make you a centaur. There are currently 3 Mounts to choose from (Brown, Grey, & Unicorn) These Mounts can be made from 1 Blessed Apple at a cooking pot.


At this time, I do notice a few bugs and I am working to fix them ASAP.


If there are issues with this mod that I did not find, please make a pull request on the Repository page. (https://github.com/TotalTakeover/Centaur-Mount)


Current bugs:
<Priority> No Double Jump (for Unicorn Mount)
<Priority> Dash Animation is Broken
<Priority> Finding way to make legs invisible (If you know how, please let me know ASAP)
Back items do not attach properly on back (too high)
Player Idle Position & Jump Position is undesirable.
Hitbox, it's bad.


Like Most Mounts, you cannot use a grappling hook without disconnecting from the Mount.


Upcoming Features:
Different Colors, Newer sprites/Code
Maybe a Homepage


Unlikely Upcoming features:
Accessories/Vanity/armor that allows for lower body defense and stats.
