# CentaurMount

"Centaur Mount" is a mod that adds mounts to Terraria that make you a centaur. There are currently 3 Mounts to choose from (Brown, Grey, & Unicorn) These Mounts can be made from 1 Blessed Apple and another indicated item at a cooking pot.


At this time, I do notice a few bugs and I am working to fix them ASAP.


If there are issues with this mod that I did not find, please make a pull request on the Repository page. ( https://github.com/TotalTakeover/CentaurMount )


Current bugs:
*<Priority> Mounts can run fast, but they cannot prove it by dashing. They just walk really fast instead.
*<priority> Back items do not attach properly on back (too high)
*Legs occasionally slightly appear


Like Most Mounts, you cannot use a grappling hook without disconnecting from the Mount.


Upcoming Features/Bug Fixes:
*<priority> Add Dash animation (Give Unicorn Mount no Knock-back)
*<priority> Add Double Jump To "Unicorn Mount" (cuz it's special)
*Different Colors/Species
*Maybe a Homepage


Unlikely Upcoming features:
*Accessories/Vanity/armor that allows for lower body defense and stats.
