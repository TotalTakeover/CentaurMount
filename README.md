# CentaurMount

"Centaur Mount" is a mod that adds mounts to Terraria that make you a centaur. There are currently 5 Mounts to choose from. These Mounts can be made from various (obvious) items at a cooking pot/Mythril Anvil.

Current bugs:
*<priority> Back items & Usable Items do not attach properly to various locations
*<priority> Fix Description
*Need to add Double Jump To Unicorn Mount
*Legs occasionally slightly appear
*Reindeer Mount Nose does not glow. When Flying, there is no particles when flying as well

If there are issues with this mod that I did not find, please file an issue on the Repository page. ( https://github.com/TotalTakeover/CentaurMount )

Like Most Mounts, you cannot use a grappling hook without disconnecting from the Mount.

Upcoming Features:
*Different Colors/Species

Unlikely Upcoming features:
*Accessories/Vanity/armor that allows for lower body defense and stats.
*Maybe a Homepage
